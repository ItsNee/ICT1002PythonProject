EventIDs,Title,Description
1,Process creation,The process creation event provides extended information about a newly created process. The full command line provides context on the process execution. The ProcessGUID field is a unique value for this process across a domain to make event correlation easier. The hash is a full hash of the file with the algorithms in the HashType field.
6,Driver loaded,The driver loaded events provides information about a driver being loaded on the system. The configured hashes are provided as well as signature information. The signature is created asynchronously for performance reasons and indicates if the file was removed after loading.
12,RegistryEvent (object create and delete),Registry key and value create and delete operations map to this event type  which can be useful for monitoring for changes to Registry autostart locations  or specific malware registry modifications.
13,RegistryEvent (Value Set),This Registry event type identifies Registry value modifications. The event records the value written for Registry values of type DWORD and QWORD.
15,FileCreateStreamHash,This event logs when a named file stream is created  and it generates events that log the hash of the contents of the file to which the stream is assigned (the unnamed stream)  as well as the contents of the named stream. There are malware variants that drop their executables or configuration settings via browser downloads  and this event is aimed at capturing that based on the browser attaching a Zone.Identifier “mark of the web” stream.
16,Sysmon config state changed,Sysmon config state changed. This event may or may not include a hash.  A hash will depend on whether Sysmon was called with a configuration XML file or if it was just used via configuration settings on the command line.  If a configuration XML was specified then the hash of the file will be logged so that you can detect if anyone reconfigures Sysmon with an unauthorized configuration file which will produce a different hash. 
18,Pipe connected,Named pipes can be used to provide communication between processes on the same computer or between processes on different computers across a network. If the server service is running  all named pipes are accessible remotely.
